# A-Frame Gamepad example

WORK IN PROGRESS

Example, demonstrating a USB gamepad in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). Live at https://i3games.github.io/aframe-gamepad/. This setup is suited for cardboard VR where you can look around with the headset.

Here I use an Speed Link SL 6603 to interact with the scene. Other USB gamepads also work with my Android device as long as they are connecting with an USB OTG adapter.
